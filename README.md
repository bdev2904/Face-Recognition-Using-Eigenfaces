# Face-Recognition-Using-Eigenfaces

Face recognition  using dimensionality reduction and linear algebra concepts.
    
Skills: Machine Learning libraries, Python, Jupyter Notebook

# Dataset Used 

The dataset used for this project was extracted from Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW),
a database of face images designed for studying the problem of unconstrained face
recognition. The LFW Database of Faces contains 13,244 face images of 5,749 distinct
subjects, out of which 276 images of 57 distinct subjects or famous personalities have
been selected for this study, due to the overhead of computation. For each subject,
the number of images present is different, each image having a dimension of 250 x 250
pixels and 96 dpi. The images have been captured at different times, in varying light,
varied facial expressions such as open or closed eyes, smiling or not smiling and varied
facial details such as glasses or no glasses.
